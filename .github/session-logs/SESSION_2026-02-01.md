# Dev Session Notes - Feb 1, 2026

Quick notes from today's session (vibe coded with Claude).

## What We Fixed

### 1. Waterfall "Offline" Bug (UX Issue)

**The Problem:**
When capturing a satellite pass, the waterfall would just say "OFFLINE" - looked broken even though it's expected behavior (SDR can only do one thing at a time).

**The Fix:**
Added overlay to waterfall component showing "📡 Capturing Satellite Signal" with explanation.

**Files:** `src/frontend/src/components/WaterfallView.tsx`

### 2. Repository Cleanup

**Issues:**
- Too many .env.example files
- Non-standard `.appcontainer/` directory (only VS Code's `.devcontainer/` is special)
- Outdated documentation paths and versions
- .gitignore gaps

**Changes:**
- Deleted `.appcontainer/` directory
- Consolidated .env.example to root
- Updated all docs to use correct paths
- Updated .gitignore

**Decision:** Keep `docker/` for production configs (industry standard) + `.devcontainer/` for VS Code + `scripts/deploy/` for deployment tools.

### 3. Earlier Work

- SSTV scanner timeout fix (increased dwell time 3s → 20s)
- Deploy script SSH improvements
- Docker build speedup (separate frontend deps from source)

## Technical Decisions

**Why `docker/` not `.appcontainer/`?**
- Industry standard location
- `.devcontainer` is special (VS Code recognizes it)
- Not worth moving everything for symmetry

## Files Changed

- `src/frontend/src/components/WaterfallView.tsx` - capture overlay
- `.env.example` - consolidated & documented
- `.gitignore` - filled gaps
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` - version, paths
- `README.md` - updated references
- Deleted: `.appcontainer/`

**Version:** 2.0.0  
**Date:** Feb 1, 2026
