# Session Logs & Work Notes

This folder contains development session notes and work-in-progress documentation that are not part of the main project documentation.

**Not in official docs** because these are:
- Development session notes (one-time events)
- Work-in-progress TODOs
- Decision notes (moved to [ADRs](../adr/) if significant)

Use these for context when reviewing past decisions or session history.

## Contents

- `SESSION_2026-02-01.md` - Dev session notes: waterfall overlay fix, repo cleanup
- `GITHUB_ACTIONS_TODO.md` - Test typing issues needing resolution in CI
